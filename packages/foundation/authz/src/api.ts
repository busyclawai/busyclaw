// The product-API decision surface — `decideApiCall`, the `ClawApi::` PARC entry point (the sibling of
// the floor's `Tool::` tool path). It runs on a SEPARATE Cedar engine from the tool floor
// (`cedarApiEngine`), namespace-isolated: a `ClawApi::Action` policy structurally cannot permit a
// `Tool::Action` request and vice versa. `decideApiCall` is what the assembly's product-API PEP calls
// before every governed `claw.api` method.
//
// THE ACCESS MODEL IS GENERIC — no tiers, no roles, no org. The PEP never learns "admin" vs
// "self-service" or what "organization" means; it checks a GENERIC ACL over an OPAQUE resource SHAPE
// (`{ createdBy, scope, scopeId, grants }`) and the caller's OPAQUE held-scope facts, evaluated as REAL
// CEDAR over a per-request ENTITY GRAPH — NOT integer context facts:
//
//   owner        — `resource.createdBy == principal`            (entity/attr equality, LIVE)
//   scope-member — `principal in resource.requiredScopeAccess`  (leveled `in`, dormant)
//   grant        — `principal in resource.requiredGrantAccess`  (leveled `in`, dormant)
//
// The LEVEL ordering (`read < use < manage`) is CEDAR'S, expressed as an access-node hierarchy
// `…:manage in …:use in …:read`: the caller is `in` the node its scope/grant grants, the resource's
// `requiredXAccess` attribute points at the node for the action's required level, and being `in` a higher
// node is transitively being `in` every lower one — so a `use` member satisfies a `read` requirement but
// NOT a `manage` one, decided entirely by Cedar `in`, never a TS `>=`. The busyclaw side only RENDERS the
// graph (which held scope/grant maps to which node — kind-blind, opaque labels); every DECISION is
// Cedar's. `scope`/`scopeId`/`principalRef` are opaque; the three permits live in `API_ACCESS_BASELINE`
// (the un-removable api floor). Owner is LIVE; scope-member and grant are present-but-dormant (their `in`
// edges are empty until the org plugin resolves scopes and the access_grant table lands) — the
// POLICY and the RENDERING ship now, the DATA arrives later.
